The project included various implications such as complex problem solving, a high degree of mathematical modeling, precise CAD designing, and Arduino coding and wiring. Combining everything, a final, functioning prototype was created."

The project included the use of Arduino in C++. The robot moved using 2 servo motors while the scoop was powered by a separate servo. A LIDAR detector was used to find walls and indicate when to turn. 2 photoresistors were responsible for line following. As a result, I was able to create a working prototype that completed its assigned tasks.",

      "description": "I led a team of fellow students to develop a prototype autonomous emergency response robot as part of a semester long project, utilizing ROS2, Arduino, Python, and C++. We applied what we learned in our courses to equip the robot with a thermal camera for heat spot detection, making it highly effective in emergency situations. To enhance its efficiency and safety, we incorporated LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance and a PID controller, directly applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges. Additionally, we designed the mounts and system architecture using SOLIDWORKS and Miro. This project allowed us to bring together classroom concepts and real-world applications in a meaningful way.",

      "description": "As a member of an Agile team of six, I contributed to the development and comparison of four lightweight encoder-decoder models for image captioning using Keras. We employed a modified pretrained VGG16 convolutional neural network to extract image features from the Flickr8k dataset. Throughout this process, I gained significant knowledge and skills in deep learning, model optimization, and teamwork. To showcase our work, I created an interactive website with a React.js frontend and Flask backend, demonstrating the models and their bidirectional variants at the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI (CUCAI). Additionally, I co-authored and published a research paper for CUCAI, presenting an in-depth analysis of our experiment's findings. This project was a tremendous learning experience, enhancing my technical expertise and collaborative abilities.",

      "description": "During the summer of 2024, I revamped Emergency Response Mobile Robot to create SLAM Autonomous Robot V2. This enhanced version includes the implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using Nav2, further advancing the robot's navigational capabilities. By integrating SLAM, the robot now possesses an improved ability to map and navigate complex environments autonomously, solidifying its potential as a critical tool in emergency response scenarios. In addition, I plan to attach a camera to the robot and implement object detection using OpenCV to follow a user around an area.",
