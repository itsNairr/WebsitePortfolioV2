      "description": "I developed a customer-centric website that allows patrons to browse menu options and discover current promotions with ease. The site boasts a responsive front end, built Next.js and Tailwind CSS. At its core, a dynamic RESTful API built with Next.js Server enables staff to effortlessly manage menu updates, while the integration of Auth0 ensures secure administrator access for content control. Additionally, MongoDB Atlas underpins the system as the robust database solution, streamlining the management of menu data for an optimized user experience.",

It is built with Next.js and TypeScript, with styling done in Tailwind CSS. I also used Redux to manage the state of the website. I am very happy with how it turned out, and I am excited to continue to improve it.",

      "description": "In my first-year course, APSC-101, me and three others formed a group to create a working robotic assistive arm that functioned to lift various objects for those who had disabilities. The project included various implications such as complex problem solving, a high degree of mathematical modeling, precise CAD designing, and Arduino coding and wiring. Combining everything, a final, functioning prototype was created."

      "description": "Programmed an autonomous line follower robot that was able to independently traverse a test arena while picking up and transporting plastic wire caps using a scoop. The project included the use of Arduino in C++. The robot moved using 2 servo motors while the scoop was powered by a separate servo. A LIDAR detector was used to find walls and indicate when to turn. 2 photoresistors were responsible for line following. As a result, I was able to create a working prototype that completed its assigned tasks.",
